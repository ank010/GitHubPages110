# Arjun Kumar
## UCSD Class of 2025
### Computer Engineering with Poli Sci Minor


### **Hello everyone!** *I'm Arjun* and I'm born and **raised in _sunny_ San Diego**. 
### I'm currently a ***Computer Engineering major in Warren College at UCSD***. I chose the major because it is a great middle ground between purely programming like I would do in CS and the tough electrical stuff I would have to do if I was an EE major. 

## The Professional Stuff

<sub>I do enjoy the software side more, but I love building things with my hands and physically being able to touch the product I am creating.</sub>
> The main field that I have an interest in is Wireless Communications

Mainly in 5G NR systems. I have already had a couple summers worth of experience and looking for more in the near future. 

An important distinction between `5G and 4G` is that 5G uses several different frequencies to send signals on a certain band while 4G uses the same frequency for all signals but shifts them to differentiate them. Since there are so many wireless devices, it is hard to make space for new devices to use. By using different frequencies for the `sub-carriers`, 5G allows for many more devices to use frequencies on the same band.

Anyway, outside of that I have been programming since the early days of middle school, mainly using an arduino to program simple circuits with LEDs and motors. My interests really ramped up in high school and obviously in college as well.  

The programming languages I have used the most are 
```
print(Python)
System.out.println(Java)
cout << "C++"
```
I am confident in my programming skills, but the area I really excell is in finding effective solutions to problems. I'm really good at solving puzzles and that's how I attack program development - a puzzle I have to create a solution to in order to get to my end goal - a successfuly working program. 

## The Personal Stuff

>I'm a big sports guy, always have been.

Here's another picture of me playing Golf: [Another Golf Pic](./HP-4.jpg)       <sub>(Relative Link)</sub>

I've played sports since I can remember. Everything from football to volleyball to soccer. I mainly played basketball and golf competitively through high school. I am quite competitive and it comes through in my work as well. Playing sports has really made me who I am more than anything else. I love watching sports too, even if Polo is on the TV I'll sit down and watch for a little. It doesn't matter. 

>Music

Like many of us, music plays a pretty big part in my life. While I don't play instruments any more, I love listening non-stop and writing lyrics as well. My favorite genres currently are Hip Hop, R&B, Indie Pop and UK Drill. Below are links to songs/albums that have been in my rotation pretty heavily recently.

>Photography

One of the interests I picked up from my dad is that of photography. As such, I have been taking photos with DSLRs for quite some time and I really enjoy it. I normally take very vibrant photos that have a very static feel to them. I like taking portraits as well as candids. Below are some of the photos I took/created last quarter. Checkout my photography instagram [here](https://www.instagram.com/akphotography_13/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y%3D). Make sure to drop me a follow!

> Tattoos

Something I've really fallen in love with over the past couple years are tattoos. While I don't have as many as i want, yet, getting them is quite addicting. Many people say they don't have anything meaningful to tattoo so they never get one. I could argue that meaning doesn't matter at all however. Sure, the design should be something that you really like and enjoy to look at, but there doesn't have to always be a deeper meaning. 

Here are my tips for getting a tattoo:
1. Design: tools like Instagram are great for finding ideas but put your personal touch on them. If you are having trouble, tattoo artists usually have 'flash sheets' from which you can choose from. 
2. Tattoo shop+artist: I personally looked on google maps for highly rated shops close to me, but many people travel for specific artists. Depending on your budget, you can expand your search. Once you find a well-rated shop, look them up on Instagram and select an artists based on the style of tattoo you are getting. 
3. Confidence: Make sure you truley love your design. It is far more expensive to remove or redo a tattoo than to change the design beforehand. Make sure you are confident in your design, placement and artist. 
4. Hidrate + Eat Well: Depending on the size of tattoo, you could be sitting there for hours on end and it can be suprisingly taxing. Make sure to eat beforehand
5. Healing: Listen to your tattoo artists and let the tattoo heal properly.
6. Enjoy!: Show of and really enjoy your art. 

I still get small hits of dopamine when I look at tattoos I got a year and a half ago. 
This is my To-do list of the next few tattoos I'm getting:

- [ ]  Sword and Rose along Right Forearm
- [ ]  SD Logo inner left forearm
- [ ]  Lighter with floral design outer left forearm
- [ ]  Glass half full 
- [ ]  13 on right wrist

I'll check them off once I've got them, and add the next batch later.
